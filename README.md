# Star Technology(or StarT for short)
Star technology is one of the first GregTech modpacks to be released in 1.19.2, now brought to 1.20.1! This modpack is still in full development! Post-UHV content will be coming soon! However, it should be playable up to Classic Stargate.

This pack is not targeted towards new GregTech players, but we are trying to make it more approachable to begginers as well!

This pack borrows concepts and ideas from other GregTech modpacks like Nomifactory, Gregtech: New Horizons and Technological Journey in form of a skyblock. Shout out to their creators for their amaizing projects! Do check them out as well!
