# Star Technology(or StarT for short)

Star technology is one of the first GregTech modpacks to be released in 1.19.2, now brought to 1.20.1! This modpack is still in full development! Post-UHV content will be coming soon! However, it should be playable up to the Classic Stargate.

This pack is not targeted towards new GregTech players but we are trying to make it more approachable to beginners as well!

This pack borrows concepts and ideas from other GregTech modpacks like Nomifactory, Gregtech: New Horizons and Technological Journey but in form of a skyblock. Shout out to the creators of these other modpacks for their amazing projects! Do check them out as well!
